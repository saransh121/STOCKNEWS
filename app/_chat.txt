 Adani Group 
25 January 2023

We are shocked that Hindenburg Research has published a report on 24 January 2023 without making any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix

The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts.

The timing of the report’s publication clearly betrays a brazen, mala fide intention to undermine the Adani Group’s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming Follow-on Public Offering from Adani Enterprises, the biggest FPO ever in India.

The investor community has always reposed faith in the Adani Group on the basis of detailed analysis and reports prepared by financial experts and leading national and international credit rating agencies.

Our informed and knowledgeable investors are not influenced by one-sided, motivated and unsubstantiated reports with vested interests.

The Adani Group, which is India’s leader in infrastructure and job creation, is a diverse portfolio of market-leading businesses managed by CEOs of the highest professional calibre and overseen by experts in various fields for several decades.

The Group has always been in compliance with all laws, regardless of jurisdiction, and maintains the highest standards of corporate governance.

-Jugeshinder Singh, Group CFO, Adani

✅ Investing is simple, but not easy. Simple to understand key principles, but not easy to stay disciplined about it.

✅ Returns is quantifiable, but the risk is not. And this is where most investors falter.

✅ Size of the industry opportunity is the foundation of growth investing. Market values future visibility more than past growth.

✅ Not all growth is valued equally. Capex from internal accruals matters more than Capex from debt

✅  A business must create Economic Value, ie, higher return on incremental capital over its cost of running the business.

✅ The basic trick is avoid looking at valuation as first filter, but at quality. Pure cheapness is never a virtue.

 ✅ In bad businesses, the returns, if at all, can only be point to point; you never know those points.

✅ The basic trick is NOT to look at valuations as first filter, but at quality. Pure cheapness is never a virtue.

Yes, you heard that right.
But you don't need to worry.

Here's why:

Thanks to UPI, India built a tremendously strong financial infrastructure over the course of years.

But with great power comes great responsibilities.

Upon doing so, it created a bunch of Prepaid Payment Instruments or PPIs around the corner to take benefit of this digital revolution.

PPIs include e-wallets such as Paytm, PhonePe, Amazon Pay, etc.

Now all this time, these PPIs were giving out their services for free and taking the blow of burning cash along the process as they had to face the high cost of UPI transactions.

So, NPCI stepped in.

NPCI as in The National Payments Corporation of India.

NPCI stepped in to look into the matter and recommended an interchange fee of 1.1% on UPI.

But those are only for payments above Rs.2000.

And that too only the >Rs.2000 payments that are made via PPIs.

The sole purpose of this initiative is to make sure that it increases the revenue for the banks & payment service providers.

But don't worry...it won't hurt you.

Because it's not the customer who's going to pay the 1.1% fee.

It's the merchant.

The merchant will pay the interchange fee to the PPIs.

For example: 

Let's say you got to Westside. 

And you see this beautiful black dress hanging over that shelf. 

You see the price tag, it says Rs.4999. 

Let's say it was 5k. 

Now you go to the counter and pay for it using your Paytm wallet.

Now here you'll be paying only 5k and not the 1.1% of it or the Rs.55.

Why?

Because Westside will pay that 55 rupees to Paytm.

Yes, that's a headache for Tata. 

You need not worry about it.

[14/05/2023, 7:17:34 PM] ~ Stock Nivesh: *Why Airline Industry is always struggling?*

Costs are a big reason why most airlines in India do not make any money. To survive, all airline companies have to ensure that they manage their cost-effectively and reduce them to the extent possible. Let us understand the costs one by one.


📌 Fuel cost

Fuel is the airline industry's primary cost and is a major expense for any airline company.


📌Leasing cost

Airlines, nowadays, lease aircraft rather than buying, as it costs a lot to buy one. They rent aircraft for an extended period, for which, in return, they have to pay lease rentals which is also a major chunk of the total cost that an airline bears. The leasing cost is very simple to calculate as the number of aircraft a company has, the greater its leasing cost.

📌Other costs

Other than the above two mentioned costs, there are also some significant costs that a company can't ignore. For example, salary, purchase of stock in trade, finance costs, depreciation of the aircraft, etc. These costs may not look that significant, but in reality, they are!

Employee costs, for example, amount to huge costs; an aircraft's depreciation and maintenance costs are also huge.

*In 1994, Tanishq was launched to take Titan to the next level, but it FAILED!*

*Everyone asked Ratan Tata to shut it down and cut the losses*

*To their utter shock, Tanishq went onto makes 85% of Titan's 29 billion dollar business*

*Here's the CRAZY story:*

The term Tanishq was coined by late Mr. Xerxes Desai by marrying the words ‘Tan’ meaning body and ‘Nishk’ meaning a gold ornament. 

Titan got overconfident after turning its watch making business a success. 

This led it to believe that it understands the wearable market deeply.

And so, Titan launched it’s jewelry segment, but there was a catch!

It aimed to transform the consumer behavior by building an appetite on 18-karat jewelry instead of the 22-karat standard

—which turned out to be a great failure. But why?

Because, the company failed to understand that in India, gold is seen as a symbol of wealth & fortune rather than as an accessory.

Any attempt at democratizing high-status products will only result in a failure!

Just like Nano.

Nano was an attempt by TATA to give every middle-class Indian a car, but none of us wanted our identity to be attached with “the cheapest car” in the world.

This could’ve lowered our social status and do we want that? NO!

For nearly half a decade, Titan failed to understand this.

And TATA continued to bleed from it’s jewelry segment.

The problem?

You see, before Tanishq, the Indian jewelry sector was largely unorganized.

• Local jewelers were the kings and customers relied on their word.

• No way to assure price and purity of the gold.

• Limited designs.

How did Tanishq solve that?

After facing a huge setback in the domestic market, TATA realized that it was doing something wrong.

Tanishq accepted the Indian consumers’ psyche.

Apart from launching 22-karat jewellery, it introduced “Karatmeter” that checks Gold’s purity in it’s major retail stores.

Now, this was a gamechanger as —

👉🏼 Many women started pouring in Tanishq stores to check the purity of their pieces.

👉🏼 Nearly 60% of them tested below the caratage their family jeweler had assured. This led to loss of faith in their generational family jewelers.

👉🏼 To top it off, if the purity was found to be lesser than what was claimed, Tanishq replaced the piece with higher purity, while only charging the customer making charges. Gold upgrade was free!

This boosted the customers’ confidence in Tanishq.

_Now, Tanishq is well-known to adapt to market requirements._

It aligns the marketing strategy apt to the buying behavior of it’s target segment.

The previous generation saw gold as an investment instrument and occasional wearable.

But the generation of today is more financially aware and besides investment, they see jewelry as a style statement.

To cater this need, Tanishq launched Mia (meaning “Mine” in Italian).

The jewelry is 14-karat and lightweight which makes it affordable for the customers.

Now, weddings in India account for 50% of jewelry bought in the country.

Tanishq saw this as a great opportunity.

In 2017, it launched its sub-brand Rivaah, a beautiful union of ‘Riwaaz’ and ‘Vivah’, that focused on this market.

Every other jewelry brand sells wedding jewelry, then what’s so special about Rivaah?

Well, Rituals are soul of a wedding and every piece of wedding jewelry is a symbol of these rituals.

Rivaah introduced a range of designs that keeps cultures and traditions in mind. 

You can buy state-specific designs that suits your cultural values.

Currently, Tanishq yields over 20% of its sales from the wedding jewelry segment.

Imagine, if Titan had shut down Tanishq when it was a loss making business?!

From selling time to being timeless, it has built a billion dollar empire.

And this couldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t for Tanishq.

[18/05/2023, 10:14:53 PM] ~ Stock Nivesh: 📌 "𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀: 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲!"📌

➡️ Here are some common trading mistakes to be aware of:

✅ 𝗟𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗘𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: One of the biggest mistakes traders make is diving into the markets without sufficient knowledge and understanding. It's essential to invest time and effort in learning about different trading strategies, market dynamics, risk management techniques, and the instruments you're trading.

✅ 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗮 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻: Trading without a well-defined plan is a recipe for disaster. Many traders make the mistake of relying on gut feelings or impulsive decisions. A trading plan should include clear entry and exit points, risk management guidelines, and a systematic approach to decision-making. Following a plan can help you stay disciplined and avoid emotional trading, which often leads to poor outcomes.

✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴: Overtrading leads to increased transaction costs, dilutes focus, and heightens the risk of impulsive decisions. It's important to be selective, patient, and trade based on well-defined strategies rather than succumbing to the urge to be constantly active.

✅ 𝗡𝗲𝗴𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗥𝗶𝘀𝗸 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Effective risk management is a cornerstone of successful trading.

✅ 𝗘𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻-𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: Emotions can be a trader's worst enemy. Fear and greed often cloud judgment and lead to irrational decision-making. Making impulsive trades based on emotional reactions rather than objective analysis can be detrimental to your trading performance. Developing emotional intelligence and maintaining discipline are vital for overcoming these biases.

✅ 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀: When faced with a losing trade, it's natural to want to recoup losses immediately. However, chasing losses by increasing position sizes or taking on excessive risks can amplify losses further. It's important to accept losses as part of the trading process and focus on executing your trading plan consistently rather than trying to chase quick profits.

✅ 𝗟𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Patience is a virtue in trading. Impatient traders often jump into trades prematurely or exit too early, missing out on potential profits. Successful trading requires waiting for favorable setups and allowing trades to play out according to your plan. Cultivating patience and discipline can significantly improve your trading results.

♨️If we want to understand the stock market, firstly, we need to understand the word market." When we hear the word market, the first thing that comes to mind is vegetable market, fruit market, "fish market, etc.

♨️If we look closely, we will find a commonality in all markets: the availability of buyers and sellers in one place, doing end-to-end transactions on a daily basis.

♨️Now we have a basic understanding of the market, let’s go much deeper. Tell me one thing: if you want to buy vegetables, then where will you go.......🤔 We go to the vegetable market😆

♨️In the same way, if you want to buy shares of any listed company, you need to go to the stock market.

♨️Share market like any other market where end no. of buyers and sellers are available, and they are doing end no. transactions on a daily basis.

𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘁𝘀

♨️If we look at the vegetable market more closely, we can find various market participants like farmers, whole-sellers, retailers, transport, the government, etc.

♨️In the same way, stock market also has multiple participants, like investors and traders, market intermediaries, regulators, the stock exchange, and companies etc.

[23/05/2023, 9:45:23 PM] ~ Stock Nivesh: The winner of this year’s IPL is.... 

*“Rajasthan Royals”* 🤨

Don’t be shocked it’s true! 

The only difference is they will be picking up a cheque rather than a
trophy.

Tiger Global which is a global tech focused VC firm is reportedly in talks to invest around $40 Mn in the Indian Premier League (IPL) team Rajasthan Royals.
 
This move signifies Tiger Global's increasing involvement in India's sports economy.

They are looking to invest in Rajasthan Royals at a valuation of $650 Mn.

Why does a VC firm want to invest in a sports team and that too RR?

To understand this first we need to know how does an IPL team earn money? 

They have four major sources of revenue.
 
*1) Media rights:* BCCI shares a portion of the money they receive from selling the media rights of IPL with the teams.

Media rights refer to the money that
companies pay to broadcast IPL matches on television or digital platforms.

*2) Sponsorships:* In IPL, teams receive money from brands in exchange for
displaying their name and logo on the team's jerseys.

There are two types of sponsorships involved 

— IPL sponsorships and brand
sponsorships.

BCCI, receives money from TATA as part of this sponsorship deal.

The BCCI then shares a portion of the IPL sponsorship money with the teams
participating in the league.

*3) Stadium Ticket sales:* One of the most important sources of money for IPL
franchises is ticket sales revenue. 

The team's owners choose ticket prices.

A certain percentage of the cash from ticket sales is shared with the sponsors and the BCCI, while the remaining amount goes to the team's wallet.
 
*4) Merchandise sales:* The IPL franchises also make money through the sale of official merchandise such as shirts, souvenirs, and athletic equipment. 

India's sports equipment and apparel market was worth $28 billion in 2022 and is likely to swell to $40.6 billion by 2027

*5) Prize Money:* The prize money awarded in IPL, is relatively low when compared to other sources of income, with the winning team receiving a whopping INR 20 crore while the runners-up received INR 13 crore.

Now you know, that the teams are not running behind the trophy or the winning cheque but their main focus is to increase their brand value. 
 
Winning an IPL trophy is one such way, last year Rajasthan royals played the final with Gujarat Titans.

A team which used to get eliminated early in the league made some great investments in terms of their players. 
 
They have Jos Buttler, who can act as a nightmare for any bowling attack on a
good day.

Don’t forget the combination of Chahal and Ashwin, one of them is the
leading wicket taker of IPL and the other is living legend of Indian cricket team.

Their strategy of backing young Indian players like Yashasvi Jaiswal has given them great results.
 
Why do people support MI, RCB and CSK? 

Because they have three big players of the Indian team.
 
The day when Yashasvi or Sanju Samson seal their spot in the national team, the overall brand value of RR will certainly increase.

Tiger Global was one of the early backers of e-commerce giant Flipkart and holds stakes in cab aggregator Ola, food delivery platform Zomato and Delhivery.
 
Although their investment has not given them the expected results. 
 
This is the reason they are looking for more sure and safe bets.
 
They recently invested in Chaayos and Wow! Momos, and they are already in talks to invest in a few other IPL teams. 
 
The deal with RR is expected to close soon.

IPL is flowing with money.

✓ Pricing power refers to a company's ability to control and adjust the prices of its products or services in the market without significantly impacting demand or sales.
✓ It signifies the level of influence a company has over its pricing decisions and its customers' willingness to accept higher prices.

📌 𝑭𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒐𝒓𝒔 𝒊𝒏𝒇𝒍𝒖𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒑𝒓𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒑𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒓:

✓ Market competition: High competition limits pricing power as customers have more options, making it difficult for a company to raise prices without losing market share.

✓ Product differentiation: Unique features, quality, or brand reputation enhance pricing power by creating customer perception of higher value, allowing a company to charge premium prices.

✓ Customer demand and sensitivity: Strong demand and low price sensitivity enable higher pricing power as customers are willing to pay higher prices without significant impact on sales.

✓ Cost structure and production efficiency: Lower production costs and efficient operations provide pricing power by allowing a company to offer competitive prices or maintain higher profit margins.

✓ Regulatory environment: Regulatory restrictions or price controls imposed by authorities can limit pricing power by setting maximum price limits or introducing regulations on pricing strategies.

📌 𝑹𝒂𝒏𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑺𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒐𝒓𝒔 𝒃𝒚 𝑷𝒓𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑷𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒓: 𝑭𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝑯𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝑳𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒔𝒕 💸💪

✓ Pharmaceutical and Healthcare
✓ Luxury Goods and Services
✓ Technology and Software
✓ Energy and Utilities
✓ Airlines
✓ Financial Services
✓ Telecommunications

✓ Automotive
✓ Retail
✓ Construction and Real Estate

📢
It's important to note that pricing power can fluctuate within sectors and may not apply universally to all companies within a specific industry. Market conditions, customer preferences, and other external factors can impact pricing power significantly.

[29/05/2023, 9:06:42 PM] ~ Stock Nivesh: ✅ WHAT IS ADR ??

- American Depository Receipt.

👉 American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are financial instruments issued by U.S. banks that represent ownership of shares in foreign companies.

👉 Purpose :

ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without the need to directly buy and hold shares on foreign stock exchanges.

👉 Structure :

ADRs are created when a U.S. bank purchases shares of a foreign company in the local market and deposits them with a custodian bank. The U.S. bank then issues ADRs, which are traded on U.S. stock exchanges.

👉 Currency :

ADRs are typically denominated in U.S. dollars, allowing investors to avoid currency exchange costs and fluctuations.

👉 Types of ADRs :

There are two main types of ADRs: sponsored ADRs and unsponsored ADRs. Sponsored ADRs are established with the cooperation and approval of the foreign company, while unsponsored ADRs are initiated by a U.S. bank without the direct involvement of the foreign company.

👉 Benefits :

ADRs provide U.S. investors with access to a broader range of investment opportunities, diversification across different countries and industries, and the convenience of trading on U.S. exchanges.

👉 Reporting and Transparency :

ADR issuers are required to provide financial statements and periodic reports in accordance with U.S. accounting and disclosure standards, enhancing transparency for investors.

Global engineering and product development giant Tata Technologies Limited is looking to hire 1,000 women engineers in 2023-24 in a bid to promote gender diversity in its workforce, reports The Economic Times.

The company launched its gender diversity hiring campaign, which will involve attracting and onboarding a diverse talent pool and creating support frameworks for them to succeed.

The company also said it runs a six-month developmental programme focusing on helping women employees develop their leadership potential further, along with focusing on creating an environment that nurtures a diverse workforce.

Tata Technologies in February announced it would hire 1,000 more people in FY23 than the planned 3,000 to cater to the requirements of customers amid a growth in business

▶️A balloon payment refers to the concept of final amount due on a loan that is structured as a series of small monthly payments followed by a single much larger amount at the end of the loan period.

▶️As the term "𝘽𝘼𝙇𝙇𝙊𝙊𝙉" suggests, the final payment on this type of loan is significantly huge.

▶️Balloon payment occurs most often in the case of mortgages.

▶️When a person take out a loan with a balloon payment, he may have lower payments in years leading up to the final one. Then he may end up owing one extra-large payment at the end of loan period.

▶️ Such payment is more often used for business loans.

▶️Balloon payments are an option for home mortgages, auto loans, and business loans.

▶️Borrowers with high creditworthiness are considered because the interest rate is usually higher for a balloon loan.

▶️There’s always the risk that the borrower won’t be able to afford that large payment when it comes due. For that reason, balloon loans are often better suited to commercial lending and business loans

▶️Modern portfolio theory (MPT) argues that it's possible to design an ideal portfolio that will provide the investor maximum returns by taking on the optimal amount of risk.
▶️ It was developed by economist Harry Markowitz in the 1950s; his theories surround the importance of portfolios, risk, diversification, and the connections between different kinds of securities.
▶️In particular, MPT advocates diversification of securities and asset classes or the benefits of not putting all your eggs in one basket.
▶️MPT says stocks face both systematic risk—market risks such as interest rates and recessions—as well as unsystematic risk—issues that are specific to each stock, such as management changes or poor sales.
▶️Proper diversification of a portfolio can't prevent systematic risk, but it can dampen, if not eliminate, unsystematic risk.

The issue of 28% GST on online gaming has rattled the gaming industry and gamers alike. Earlier this month, the 50th GST Council decided to levy 28% tax on online gaming, casino and horse racing on full value. However, it has now emerged that the Centre might re-consider the issue.

The GST Council is expected to meet next week on August 2 to discuss the 28 per cent GST on full face value. It is expected that the proposal will be put up before the GST Council in the next meeting.

-
    *1. Money is a tool.*
*It's not an end in itself.*

    *2. Don't let your emotions control your spending.*
*Be mindful of the emotions that can drive you to overspend, and learn to control them.*

    *3. Invest for the long term.*
*The stock market will go up and down in the short term, but over the long term, it goes up*.

    *4. Don't try to time the market.*
*No one can predict the future, so don't try to guess when to buy and sell stocks.*

    *5. Diversify your investments.*
*Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your money across different asset classes to reduce your risk.*

    *6. Don't be afraid to take risks.*
*But don't be reckless either.*

    *7. Pay yourself first.*
*Make sure you save money for your future before you spend it on anything else.*

    *8. Live below your means.*
*The less you spend, the more money you'll have to save and invest.*

    *9. Don't compare yourself to others.*
*Everyone is on their own journey. Focus on your own financial goals and don't worry about what others have.*

    *10. Be patient.*
*Building wealth takes time. Don't expect to get rich quick.*

    *11. Be grateful.*
*Appreciate what you have, both in terms of your financial situation and in your life in general.*

    *12. Help others.*
*One of the best ways to feel good about your money is to use it to help others.*

    *13. Be kind to yourself.*
*Everyone makes mistakes. Don't beat yourself up if you make a financial mistake. Just learn from it and move on.*

    *14. Never give up.*
*The road to financial independence is long and winding, but it's worth it. Keep working hard and never give up on your goals.*

    *15. Money can't buy happiness.*
*But it can buy peace of mind and security.*

*The Psychology of Money is a book about the emotional side of money. It's about how our feelings about money can lead us to make bad decisions. It's also about how to overcome these emotional biases and make better financial decisions.*

RBI has now come to the rescue of these account holders who face difficulties in tracing their forgotten bank money by launching Unclaimed Deposits – Gateway to Access inforMation or UDGAM

W𝐡𝐚𝐭’𝐬 𝐚𝐧 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐝 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭?

🔸Any balance in a savings or current account, which hasn’t been operated for 10 years, or 
🔸Any term deposit that hasn’t been claimed within 10 years from the date of maturity 
 
These unclaimed amounts are transferred by banks to an RBI-maintained fund - Depositor Education and Awareness (DEA) Fund. Depositors can claim deposits from the bank it was held in, along with the applicable interest, but despite public awareness campaigns by banks & RBI, the unclaimed deposits had risen to a mammoth Rs 35,000 crore as of Feb 2023

If X wants term insurance worth Rs. 2 crore, they should never purchase just one such policy from a single insurer. 

We constantly advise our clients to diversify their coverage by purchasing two insurance plans from two separate insurers. 

If one insurance company denies your claim, there is a chance that at least one insurance company will approve it because insurance companies frequently find minor reasons to deny claims when family members handle the paperwork for claim payouts.

Never rely on claim settlement ratios that appear to be high. While selecting a term plan, there are other factors while considering good term plan.

*Bonus Tip 2:*
The earlier you take, the lower premium you will have to pay throughout the course of the term based on your age.

Seven months after the US-based short seller, Hindenberg Research, came out with an explosive report on the Adani Group, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), an organisation funded by figures like George Soros and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund - is planning another 'expose' on certain corporate houses in India, reported PTI news agency.

OCCRP is a global network of investigative journalists which "exposes crime and corruption so the public can hold power to account", says the description on its website. The group might publish a report or a series of articles on certain corporate houses in India, said the PTI report.

It’s to know when to give it a shot; if it doesn’t work, have a time stop or a money stop and don’t do it after that, and I think anyone who claims that it’s easy to make money trading the market is a bad influence. Just stay away from that person.* -Nithin Kamath

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, has started a test project with Amazon. This test project will last for six months.

This means that when people use IRCTC's services, like booking train tickets or other things related to Indian railways, they will also be able to access Amazon's online store.

In addition to shopping on Amazon, users of IRCTC will also be able to use Amazon's services for paying bills and recharging their accounts. So, it's like getting extra services from Amazon while using IRCTC's platform.

This is a test to see if people find it useful, and if it works well, they might continue doing it after the six-month trial period.

- Capex over last 5 years has been Rs.700cr, should enable us to do more

- 40-50% of our revenues came from the space segment last year, this year it should be 30%

- Order book from defense segment has gone up substantially

- OFS has been in offing for last couple of years, no idea when it will happen

- The Supreme Court has asked the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to respond to an appeal by MRF Ltd challenging the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's order for the CCI to reconsider and re-calculate the fine imposed on tyre companies for alleged cartelization and price manipulation.

- In August 2018, the CCI imposed penalties totaling over ₹1,788 crore on tyre companies and directed them to cease and desist from unfair business practices.

- The NCLAT, on appeal by the tyre manufacturers, ordered the CCI to pass a fresh order, considering arithmetical errors and reviewing the penalty to support the domestic tyre industry's promotion.

- The CCI had imposed fines on several companies, including Apollo Tyres, MRF Ltd, CEAT Ltd, JK Tyre, Birla Tyres, and the Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association (ATMA).

- The regulator found that tyre manufacturers had exchanged price-sensitive data through the ATMA's platform and made collective decisions on tyre prices.

For the same age of Male category Mr. XYZ needs to pay premium amt of Rs. 10385/-  

So if we calculate the difference which is around 13.47 %

Insurance companies are also encouraging to get it insured..!! 

Those who are in there 20' to early 30's dont get into trap of Endowment/ULIP plans..!! 

Keep it simple💯

[08/10/2023, 11:49:36 AM] ~ Stock Nivesh: *What is 50-20-30 Rule of Budgeting?*

🡢 What is Budgeting?

Budgeting is the process of planning and managing your money. It involves keeping track of how much you earn and how much you spend, so you can make sure you have enough for your needs, savings, and goals. It's like creating a financial roadmap to help you reach your financial destination.


🡢 Lets understand 50-20-30 Rule of Budgeting!


📌 50% Essentials

Half of your income should be allocated to your essentials, the non-negotiables in life. This includes housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, and insurance. Think of it as the sturdy base upon which you build your financial house.

Track your Spendings


📌 20% Financial Goals

This portion is your golden ticket to financial security and freedom. Allocate 20% of your income to savings, investments, and debt repayment. It's like planting seeds that will grow into a prosperous future.


📌 30%: Flexible

Life isn't just about surviving; it's about thriving. This 30% is your ticket to enjoying life today. It covers dining out, entertainment, hobbies, and those little luxuries that bring joy to your life.



⭐ Remember, personal finance isn't one-size-fits-all. The 50-20-30 rule offers a solid framework, but feel free to adjust it to your unique circumstances. It's a tool to help you achieve financial balance and peace of mind.

🎗 Let me help you simplify this term! 🎗

➡️ Term insurance is a type of life insurance policy that offers coverage to the policyholder for a fixed period of time.

📍If the insured person dies within the specified tenure then the nominee receives the sum insured i.e. the coverage amount.

✒️ Due to their accessibility and adaptability, Term Insurance policies have been popular in India for several years

Here are the key benefits of term insurance and why it should be considered by individuals and families?

1️⃣ Affordable Coverage: An individual can avail high coverage at nominal premiums rates. It is also advised to purchase a term insurance policy at a young age because older people are more prone to diseases and require more coverage which increases the premium.

2️⃣ Financial Security: The primary purpose of term insurance is to ensure financial security for your loved ones in case of your untimely demise. All the expenses can be looked after if any sudden event takes place resulting to a major financial relief.

3️⃣ Income Replacement: Major plus for breadwinner of the family as The death benefit can help replace lost income, cover day-to-day expenses, pay off debts, and even fund long-term goals such as children's education or mortgage payments.

4️⃣ Flexibility: Term insurance policies offer flexibility as You can customize the policy term that aligns with your financial goals and select a death benefit amount that adequately meets your family's needs.

5️⃣ Ideal for Specific Life Stages: Term insurance can be selected for individuals in certain life stages, such as young professionals, parents with dependent children, or individuals with significant financial responsibilities.

6️⃣ Tax Savings: Premium paid for a term insurance policy qualify for tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act for up to Rs. 1.5 Lakh. Death/Maturity under a term insurance policy are also tax free according to the Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act.

📍 There are different types of Term Insurance available in India 🇮🇳 Below are those :-

1) Level Term Insurance
2) Increasing Term Insurance
3) Decreasing Term Insurance
4) Convertible Term Insurance
5) Group Term Insurance

1. IEX buying range 130-135

2. PEL buying range 800-850

3. PB Fintech buying range 350-380 (high risk traders) 

4. Dmart partial qty at current level in worst case scenario 3200-3300

5. HDFC Bank partial qty at current level in worst case scenario 1200-1300 range

Above given range are strong on weekly zones, all stocks are fundamentally sound except PB Fintech and we opted that because huge risk reward possible. 

*Do your own study, Personally going to deploy 40% capital on above stocks and remaining during worst days

Keep target and SL as per your greed and fear.

2) UTKARSH SMALL FINANCE BANK:
As being SFB having high risk of NPA's because of the unsecured loans in rural areas as bank is also going to focus on tier-2 cities

3) CAMPUS ACTIVEWEAR:
The stock not performed well and seen strong downtrend having strong promoter holding, there is good chance of bounce

4) JIO FINANCE:
Company backed by mota bhai having good plans to start Insurance, loan against property, loan against shares,  sound boxes. In worst case scenario 170-180 possible good to accumulate in SIP mode. 

5) IRCTC:

[02/01/2024, 8:12:52 PM] ~ Stock Nivesh: *What is the e-Rupee?*
CBDC is a digital form of currency notes issued by a central bank. The term e-Rupee or the digital Rupee is coined by the RBI for digital sovereign currency. It is a legal tender issued by a central bank in digital form. It will be an additional option to the currently available forms of money. 

*Features of e-Rupee*
It is a sovereign currency issued by central banks in alignment with their monetary policy.
It is freely convertible against commercial bank money and cash.
It is a fungible legal tender which doesn’t require the holder to have a bank account.
e-Rupee must be accepted as a medium of payment, legal tender, and a safe store of value by all citizens, enterprises, and government agencies.
It offers the public broad access to digital money, which is free from credit and liquidity risk.
The digital Rupee has offline functionality, provision of universal access devices and compatibility across multiple devices.
e-Rupee will appear as a liability on the central bank’s balance sheet, similar to the paper currency.

1. Invest for Fun, Not Just Money: Embrace the joy of investing and the thrill of uncovering hidden gems. Don't let the pursuit of profit overshadow the enjoyment of the journey.

2. Fear is Kryptonite to Joy: Don't let fear dictate your investment decisions. Understand market cycles and manage your emotions for rational and long-term success.

3. Focus on the Big Moats: Seek companies with sustainable competitive advantages, like strong brands, switching costs, or network effects, providing long-term growth potential.

4. Pick Stocks, Not the Market: Don't rely on passive index funds. Actively research and choose individual stocks with strong fundamentals and growth potential.

5. Look for the Untouchables: Identify companies with resilient businesses and strong management, poised to thrive regardless of market conditions.

6. Understand the Drivers of Growth: Look beyond financial metrics and delve into the qualitative factors driving a company's success, like its culture, innovation, and customer loyalty.

7. Know Your Circle of Competence: Invest in what you understand. Stick to industries and companies where you have expertise or a strong interest to make informed decisions.

8. Be a Patient Investor: Successful investing takes time and discipline. Don't expect overnight riches, but stay committed to your long-term strategies.

9. Control What You Can Control: Focus on your investment decisions and risk management, not trying to predict the market's unpredictable movements.

10. Continuous Learning is Key: Never stop learning and adapting. Stay updated on market trends, research new companies, and refine your investment strategies over time.

[16/01/2024, 6:25:55 PM] ~ Stock Nivesh: 🏦HDFC Bank holds nearly 13% of the Nifty, making it a significant player. However, the recently reported Net Interest Margin (NIM) is a concern, marking its lowest in history.

📊 Analyzing HDFC Bank's Results

*Advances Growth:*

- System loan growth: 15-20%
- Advances growth: 62.4%
- Retail growth: 11.6%
- Corporate growth: 31.4%
- Deposits growth: 18%

*Deposit Growth:*

- HDFC Bank's deposit growth: 27.7%
- Term Deposits growth: 42.6%
- CASA ratio: 37.7%

💹 Net Interest Margin (NIM) Compression:
- NIM has fallen to 3.4%, a recurring concern for the bank.

💰 Capital Adequacy:

- Capital Adequacy: 18.4%
- TIER-1 Capital Adequacy: 16.3%
- The bank is currently well-capitalized.

📉 Asset Quality:

- Gross NPAs reduced to 1.26% from 1.34%
- PCR (Provision Coverage Ratio): 73.2%
- Net NPA ratio: 0.31%

*Verdict:*

- The bank is focusing on retail loans with improving credit costs.
- Restructured book needs monitoring.

🏦 Branch Expansion:

- Aggressive branch opening strategy.
- Aiming to be closer to clients (1-2 km instead of 5-6 km).

*Verdict:*

📊 Overall Assessment:

1. Asset quality is stabilizing.
2. Retail loan growth is resuming.
3. The bank is well-capitalized for future opportunities.

🔍While there are positive aspects, the falling NIM remains a major concern. Investors should closely monitor the NIM guidance for future developments.

[16/01/2024, 9:19:07 PM] ~ Stock Nivesh: *John D Rockfeller was once the richest man in the world. The first billionaire in the world.*

By age 25, he controlled one of the largest oil refineries in the US.

By age 31, he had become the world’s largest oil refiner.  

By age 38, he commanded 90% of the oil refined in the U.S.
                 
By 50, he was the richest man in the country.

By the time he died, he had become the richest man in the world.

As a young man, every decision, attitude, and relationship was tailored to create his personal power and wealth.

But at the age of 53, he became ill.

His entire body became racked with pain and he lost all of his hair. In complete agony, the world’s only billionaire could buy anything he wanted, but he could only digest soup and crackers.

An associate wrote, "He could not sleep, would not smile and nothing in life meant anything to him."

His personal, highly skilled physicians predicted he would die within a year.

That year passed agonizingly slowly.

As he approached death he awoke one morning with the vague realisation of not being able to take any of his wealth with him into the next world.

The man who could control the business world suddenly realized he was not in control of his own life.

He was left with a choice. He called his attorneys, accountants, and managers and announced that he wanted to channel his Assets to Hospitals, Research, and Charity work.

John D. Rockefeller established his Foundation.

This new direction eventually led to the discovery of penicillin, cures for malaria, tuberculosis and diphtheria.

But perhaps the most amazing part of Rockefeller’s story is that the moment he began to give back a portion of all that he had earned, his body’s chemistry was altered so significantly that he got better.

It looked as if he would die at 53 but he lived to be 98.

Rockefeller learned gratitude and gave back the vast majority of his wealth.

Doing so made him whole.
It is one thing to be healed.
It is another to be made whole.

Before his death, he wrote this in his dairy:

"The Supreme Energy taught me, that everything belongs to HIM, and I am only a channel to comply his wishes. My life has been one long, happy holiday; Full of work and full of play; I dropped the worry on the way and God was good to me every day.

1. Secure your life. 
You are not Laxman, and there is no Hanuman to get Sanjeevani for you.... so get health & life insurance.

2. Set your budget. 

Set "Laxman Rekha" of your financial budget and make sure not to cross it. Understand the difference between need and want .... be financially disciplined.

3. Contingency Fund.

Unexpectedly, Lord Ram was sent to 'Vanvas' for 14 Years and was forced to leave his luxurious Palace. Not everyone can live with such sudden changes in lifestyle. Have an adequate emergency fund to handle unforeseen circumstances. 

4. Be Patient/Think Long Term : 

During the 14 years of 'Vanvas', Lord Ram faced many ups and downs, including the kidnapping of Devi Sita. Lord Ram patiently waited until the situation was favourable, rather than choosing shortcuts. Stay invested for the long term, there is no shortcut to success.

5. Choose advisors wisely 

Kaikeyi took Manthara's advice... & Ramayan happened. Stay away from those trying to sell Lucrative policies, products and from distributors who are disguised as advisors for their own benefit.

6. Build Corpus

Lord Ram, Sita, and Laxman left Ayodhya with nothing. They patiently built their network and Vanar Sena over the years in order to reach the objective of defeating the Ravan. It takes patience to build a corpus, to defeat inflation in the long run.

7.Cultivate discipline.

Lord Ram practiced "Dharma" in order to be right, responsible and disciplined in life. Apply a similar theory to your life. Save judiciously, spend carefully and invest wisely for a disciplined financial life.

8. Wipe your slate and start over 

The 14-day Lanka War marked the defeat of evil and set the stage for a new path. Similarly, forget bad decisions that you made in the past and make informed decisions to streamline your financial journey.

9. Wealth creation demands time.

If you want to create wealth & have 'Sone ki lanka', have patience to sleep over investment for 14 years like Kumbhakarna had done.

10. Believe in karma
Continue to do good things and karma will eventually reach you.🔥🔥

📮   Japan's Sony Group has initiated a legal battle by claiming $90 million termination fees after it called off the merger with Zee Entertainment on January 22.

📮   Sony has invoked arbitration to refer their disputes under the merger which means both parties will undergo an arbitration process for resolution of their disputes under the merger, said Dhiraj Mhetre, partner at Khaitan Legal Associates. "Zee will be defending the claims of Sony in the arbitration, including the claim of $90 million towards termination fee."

📉 A company reducing its debt over 2-3 years is promising.

📊 Stocks with fewer shares usually outshine large caps.

⚠️ If RSI falls for 7+ months or sharply drops for 4, watch out.

💰 Sell underperformers first; keep winners a bit longer.

📉 In a 10% market dip, growth stocks could drop 15%, 20%, and 30%.

🔍 Recovery focus: Stocks down 15% or 20% could be prime after a rebound.

🚩 Beware: A stock sliding 35% to 40% in a 10% market fall signals caution.

📈 Post-dip winners: Stocks hitting new highs first are often true leaders.
